We are now looking for a **Customer Technical Program Manager!**

At NVIDIA, our employees are passionate about parallel and visual computing. We're united in our quest to transform the way graphics are used to solve some of the most complex problems in computer science. It started out as an engine for simulating human imagination, conjuring up the amazing virtual worlds of video games and Hollywood films. Today, NVIDIA’s GPU simulates human intelligence, running deep learning algorithms and acting as the brain of computers, robots, and self-driving cars that can perceive and understand the world.

This is our life’s work — to amplify human imagination and intelligence. And we've only scratched the surface of what we can accomplish when we apply our technology to it. We need passionate, hard-working and creative people to help us take on some of these once-in-a-lifetime opportunities.
